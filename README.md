# What is this?
Its Psych Engine 0.5.2h with Kade Engine 1.5.3 Input

Might add a little bit of tweaking to the engine itself

There is memory issues with input (input uses arrays) be aware of it!

After testing the Impostor Black Betrayal Update that contains special notes that shouldn't be hit, the input takes it as it should be pressed, will look into it soon
